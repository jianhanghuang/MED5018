## Project Overview
The project aims to
In this comprehensive study, we have developed a method for analyzing gene sequences with the objective of revealing the characteristics of codon usage patterns across six different species. This method encompasses data cleaning, the calculation of frequencies of codons and their corresponding amino acids, and the visualization of this information. We specifically focused on the preferences in codon usage, a non-random phenomenon observed across species. Through this analysis, we identified both the consistencies and uniqueness in codon preferences among different species, which play a crucial role in various biological processes such as gene expression, cellular functions, RNA processing, protein translation, and folding. This approach offers valuable new insights into the field of molecular genetics, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms in biological processes.

## Key Findings
The project yielded several important findings:
##### 1.Data Reliability:
* The study compared calculated data with information from public databases (Figure A).
* Results indicated a relatively small difference, emphasizing the high reliability of the calculated data.
##### 2.Amino Acid Frequency Patterns:
* Examined six species, revealing that Leu and Ser had the highest frequency, while Tyr, His, Cys, Met, and Trp had the lowest (Figure B).
* Noteworthy consistency in these patterns across all six species.
##### 3.Codon Distribution and Evolutionary Insights:
* Cluster analysis based on codon and amino acid frequency did not distinctly separate the six species (Figure C), suggesting similarity in codon distribution.
* Synonymous codon usage patterns revealed interesting relationships: mice and humans exhibited similarities, while Arabidopsis and nematodes shared more commonalities (Figure D).
* Implications suggest a common evolutionary ancestor, with preserved gene sequences and functions, reflecting conservation of gene expression throughout evolution.
* Notably, the genetic characteristics of mice, as a model mammalian species, resemble those of humans, suggesting the effectiveness of using model organisms for certain biological studies.
